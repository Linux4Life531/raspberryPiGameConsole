Game Console Project
========================

## Goal
My Goal for this project is to design and build a hand held game console. I will then code a system, aswell as multiple games. The console should be easily playable and usable without having to have an computing knowledge

## The Controller

### The Wiring 

Here is the wiring setup for the controller. Note, the orange wires would go to GPIO pins and the pink rectangle would be the screen.
